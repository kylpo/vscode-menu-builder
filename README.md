# VSCode Menu Builder

Build custom menus of commands from your settings.json.

## Features

Credit for this extension's functionality and API go to maruruh and [Quick Menu Builder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maruruh.vscode-quick-menu-builder)!

I wrote this replacement extension for two reasons:

- Add modern VSCode extension additions (like settings.json intellisense)
- Open Source
  - [maruruh/vscode-quick-menu-builder](https://github.com/maruruh/vscode-quick-menu-builder) is no longer public, and I don't like to rely on extensions that I can not make a fork/backup of. I.e. I don't want the unpublishing of an extension from the VSCode Marketplace to affect me.
